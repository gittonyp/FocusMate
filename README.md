# FocusMate 🧘‍♂️🖥️

FocusMate is a lightweight productivity tool that helps you stay focused by gently interrupting distractions.
When FocusMate detects that you are actively using a **window from your predefined distraction list**, it triggers a **1-minute guided meditation session** to help you reset your attention instead of doom-scrolling your life away.

## ✨ Features

* 🪟 **Active Window Detection **

  * Monitors the currently focused application/window.
* 🚫 **Custom Distraction List**

  * Define apps or window titles you consider distracting (e.g. browsers, social media, games).
* 🧘 **Automatic Meditation Trigger**

  * Launches a 1-minute meditation session when a distraction is detected.
* 🔁 **Non-intrusive**

  * No blocking, no shaming, just a calm interruption.
* ⚙️ **Configurable**

  * Easily edit distraction rules and meditation behavior.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. FocusMate continuously monitors the active window on your system.
2. When the active window matches an entry in your distraction list:

   * A 1-minute meditation session starts automatically.
3. After the session ends, you can return to work with a slightly clearer mind.

## ⚙️ Configuration

you can add the window you want to detect and interrupt
FocusMate matches these values against the active window title or application name.

## 🧠 Why FocusMate?

Most productivity tools **block** distractions.
FocusMate **redirects** attention instead.

Instead of fighting your brain, it gives you a short pause to reset and choose what to do next.
